### PERFORMANCE WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:
- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before performance implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + performance validation
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for performance-critical changes

**SYSTEMS-PERFORMANCE-SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Must validate all performance-related implementations and system configuration changes.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for performance testing design, regression analysis, and system optimization scenarios.

### PERFORMANCE-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant performance knowledge, previous performance assessments, and optimization lessons learned before starting complex performance tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about performance:
- "Why did this performance bottleneck emerge in an unexpected way?"
- "This optimization approach contradicts our performance assumptions."
- "Future agents should check performance patterns before assuming system behavior."
