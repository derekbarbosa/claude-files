## Strategic Journal Policy

**Query First**: Before starting any complex task, search the journal for relevant domain knowledge, previous approaches, and lessons learned. Use both:
- `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for natural language search across all entries
- `mcp__private-journal__semantic_search_insights` for finding distilled insights (when available)
- `mcp__private-journal__find_related_insights` to discover connections between concepts

Look for:
- Similar problems solved before
- Known pitfalls and gotchas in this domain  
- Successful patterns and approaches
- Failed approaches to avoid

**Record Learning**: The journal captures genuine learning â€” not routine status updates.

Log a journal entry only when:
- You learned something new or surprising
- Your mental model of the system changed
- You took an unusual approach for a clear reason
- You want to warn or inform future agents

ðŸ›‘ Do not log:
- What you did step by step
- Output already saved to a file
- Obvious or expected outcomes

âœ… Do log:
- "Why did this fail in a new way?"
- "This contradicts Phase 2 assumptions."
- "I expected X, but Y happened."
- "Future agents should check Z before assuming."

**One paragraph. Link files. Be concise.**
## Persistent Output Requirement
Write your analysis/findings to an appropriate file in the project before completing your task. This creates detailed documentation beyond the task summary.
