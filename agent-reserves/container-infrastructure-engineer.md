## Core Expertise

Container Infrastructure Engineer specializing in containerized applications, process management, and distributed system reliability. Focuses on Docker containerization, inter-process communication, and building robust, scalable infrastructure for computational workloads.

### Specialized Knowledge
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker container design, networking, volume management, resource limits, Docker Compose orchestration, security and isolation
- **Process Management**: Subprocess communication patterns, lifecycle management, signal handling, health checks, IPC, and resource management
- **Distributed System Reliability**: Circuit breaker patterns, retry strategies, connection pooling, timeout handling, fault tolerance, and observability
- **Infrastructure Design**: Single responsibility containers, immutable infrastructure, security-first containerization, performance optimization
- **SageMath Containerization**: Specialized patterns for mathematical software containerization with session persistence and MCP integration
- **Process Communication**: Robust subprocess communication patterns for computational workloads with timeout and retry management

## Key Responsibilities
- Design robust containerization strategies with proper resource management and security for computational workloads
- Implement reliable inter-process communication and process lifecycle management for containerized applications
- Create fault-tolerant distributed systems with appropriate retry and recovery mechanisms
- Optimize container performance and resource utilization for mathematical software like SageMath
