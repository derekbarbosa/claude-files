- **Quality Gates**: Analysis workflow with handoff to implementation for code changes
- **Unique Requirements**: Documentation frameworks (Di√°taxis), security considerations, code example validation

**5. scientific-documentation-specialist.md**
- **Specialization**: Scientific computing documentation, research workflow documentation
- **Tool Access**: Analysis-focused with scientific literature research capabilities
- **Quality Gates**: Analysis workflow with progressive complexity validation
- **Unique Requirements**: Scientific accuracy verification, research context validation, educational scaffolding

**6. technical-feasibility-assessor.md**

- **Tool Access**: Analysis-focused for feasibility assessment and architecture analysis
- **Quality Gates**: Analysis workflow with clear recommendation framework (APPROVE/REVISE/DEFER)
- **Unique Requirements**: Architecture mapping, implementation complexity assessment, risk analysis

## Key Standardization Features Applied

### Protected Quality Gates Section
- All agents now have protected sections with warning tags
- Prevents modification without explicit Jerry approval
- Maintains consistency across all technical specialists

### Tool Access Categorization
- **Implementation Agents**: Full tool access for creating/modifying systems
- **Analysis Agents**: Analysis-focused tools with coordination requirements for code changes
- Clear boundaries between analysis and implementation responsibilities

### Specialized Quality Requirements
Each agent maintains domain-specific quality standards:
- **Text Processing Agents**: Cross-platform testing, performance validation
- **Documentation Agents**: Content accuracy, framework compliance, audience validation
- **File Management Agent**: Mathematical object integrity, cross-system verification
- **Feasibility Agent**: Architecture mapping, risk assessment, clear recommendations

### Workflow Integration
- All agents follow systematic tool utilization checklist
- Implementation agents use full checkpoint system (A, B, C)
- Analysis agents coordinate with implementation agents for code changes
- Consistent commit discipline and attribution requirements

## Preserved Technical Expertise

### Domain Knowledge Retained
- AWK/sed compatibility across GNU, BSD, and other Unix implementations
- Mathematical object serialization and session management patterns
- Scientific documentation progressive complexity structures
- Technical feasibility assessment frameworks

### Specialized Analysis Tools
- Sequential thinking integration for complex problem decomposition
- Domain-specific journal search patterns
- Technical pattern recognition and optimization approaches
- Cross-system coordination and testing methodologies

## Implementation Notes

### Agent Categorization Logic
- **Implementation agents** create/modify code, scripts, or systems
- **Analysis agents** evaluate, document, or assess but coordinate for code changes
- Tool access reflects actual implementation responsibilities
- Quality gates match implementation vs. analysis workflows

### Quality Gate Enforcement
- Protected sections prevent unauthorized modification
- Explicit confirmations required at each checkpoint
- Clear handoff protocols between analysis and implementation
- Consistent attribution and commit discipline

All agents now follow standardized quality processes while maintaining their specialized technical expertise and domain knowledge.
