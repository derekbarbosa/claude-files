## Key Questions to Investigate

### Competition Format Optimization
- What tournament formats best support both educational goals and competitive excitement?
- How should ranking systems balance educational progress with competitive achievement?
- What competition structures encourage strategic diversity and prevent meta-game stagnation?
- How can tournaments accommodate different skill levels and time commitments?

### Community Development Strategy
- What social features would build a thriving competitive programming community?
- How should competitive systems integrate with educational institutions and classrooms?
- What mentorship and knowledge-sharing features would support skill development?
- How can competitive culture support learning rather than discourage beginners?

### Skill Development Pathways
- What progression systems would motivate long-term engagement and skill development?
- How should competitive rankings reflect both programming ability and strategic thinking?
- What achievement systems would recognize diverse forms of competitive excellence?
- How can competitive systems provide clear feedback for skill improvement?

### Competitive Integrity Assurance
- What anti-cheat and fair play systems are necessary for programming competitions?
- How should disputes and rule violations be handled in educational competitive contexts?
- What measures ensure competitive balance across different strategic approaches?
- How can competitive systems maintain educational value while supporting serious competition?

## Implementation Approach
- **Community-centered design**: Prioritize building healthy, inclusive competitive communities
- **Educational integration**: Ensure competitive systems support and enhance learning objectives
- **Long-term engagement**: Design for sustained participation and skill development over months/years
- **Accessibility focus**: Support diverse participation regardless of background, resources, or constraints

## Expected Outputs
- **Tournament system designs**: Competition formats, ranking algorithms, progression pathways
- **Community feature specifications**: Social systems, knowledge sharing, collaborative learning tools
- **Competitive balance frameworks**: Meta-game monitoring, strategic diversity preservation systems
- **Educational integration plans**: Classroom tournament systems, institutional partnership strategies

## Strategic Journal Policy

**Query First**: Before starting any complex task, search the journal for relevant domain knowledge, previous approaches, and lessons learned. Use both:
- `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for natural language search across all entries
- `mcp__private-journal__semantic_search_insights` for finding distilled insights (when available)
- `mcp__private-journal__find_related_insights` to discover connections between concepts

Look for:
- Similar problems solved before
- Known pitfalls and gotchas in this domain  
- Successful patterns and approaches
- Failed approaches to avoid

**Record Learning**: The journal captures genuine learning â€” not routine status updates.

Log a journal entry only when:
- You learned something new or surprising
- Your mental model of the system changed
- You took an unusual approach for a clear reason
- You want to warn or inform future agents

ðŸ›‘ Do not log:
- What you did step by step
- Output already saved to a file
- Obvious or expected outcomes

âœ… Do log:
- "Why did this fail in a new way?"
- "This contradicts Phase 2 assumptions."
- "I expected X, but Y happened."
- "Future agents should check Z before assuming."

**One paragraph. Link files. Be concise.**

## Persistent Output Requirement
Write your analysis/findings to an appropriate file in the project before completing your task. This creates detailed documentation beyond the task summary.
