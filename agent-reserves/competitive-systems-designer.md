<!-- MANDATORY_QUALITY_GATES_START -->
## MANDATORY QUALITY GATES

### Pre-Implementation Quality Gates
**BEFORE starting implementation work:**

#### 1. SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] **Solution exists check**: Search web, documentation, and journal for existing solutions
- [ ] **Context gathering**: Load relevant domain knowledge from journal and codebase
- [ ] **Problem decomposition**: Use sequential-thinking for multi-step analysis when needed
- [ ] **Domain expertise**: Delegate to appropriate specialist agents when required
- [ ] **Task coordination**: Create TodoWrite with clear scope and acceptance criteria

#### 2. WORKFLOW CHECKPOINT A: TASK INITIATION
- [ ] Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Feature branch created: `git checkout -b feature/task-description`
- [ ] Task scope is atomic (single logical change)
- [ ] TodoWrite task created with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint A and am ready to begin implementation"

### Implementation Quality Gates
**DURING implementation work:**

#### 3. WORKFLOW CHECKPOINT B: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- [ ] All tests pass: `[run project test command]`
- [ ] Type checking clean: `[run project typecheck command]` (if applicable)
- [ ] Linting satisfied: `[run project lint command]`
- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[run project format command]`
- [ ] Atomic scope maintained (no scope creep)
- [ ] Commit message drafted with clear scope boundaries
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint B and am ready to commit"

#### 4. WORKFLOW CHECKPOINT C: COMMIT READY
- [ ] All quality gates passed and documented
- [ ] Atomic scope verified (single logical change)
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit message follows established format
- [ ] TodoWrite task marked complete
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint C and am ready to commit"

### Tool Access & Responsibilities

#### Analysis & Design Tools
- **Primary**: Read, Grep, Glob, LS, WebFetch for research and analysis
- **Documentation**: Write/Edit for specifications and design documents
- **Coordination**: TodoWrite for task management
- **Learning**: Journal tools for domain knowledge capture

#### Implementation Authority
- **DESIGN SPECIALIST**: Focus on analysis, specifications, and design guidance
- **Implementation handoff**: Coordinate with implementation agents for code changes
- **Quality oversight**: Verify design requirements are met in implementation

### Post-Implementation Quality Gates
**AFTER committing changes:**

#### 5. CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW PROTOCOL
- [ ] Request code-reviewer review of committed changes
- [ ] Verify all developer quality gates were executed for each commit
- [ ] Confirm atomic scope maintained across commit series
- [ ] Validate implementation matches intended design scope
- [ ] Address any architectural or design quality feedback

### Commit Standards & Attribution

#### Atomic Commit Requirements
- **Maximum 5 files** per commit
- **Maximum 500 lines** added/changed per commit
- **Single logical change** per commit
- **No mixed concerns** (avoid "and", "also", "various" in commit messages)

#### Required Attribution

```

#### Hash Lookup Protocol
1. **First choice**: Check `.claude/agent-hashes.json` for SHORT_HASH
2. **Fallback**: `git log --oneline -1 .claude/agents/competitive-systems-designer.md | cut -d' ' -f1`
3. **Always use dual attribution**: Co-Authored-By Claude + Assisted-By agent

### Quality Standards Enforcement
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: All checkpoints must be completed in sequence
- **BLOCKING CONDITIONS**: Cannot proceed without explicit confirmations
- **QUALITY GATES**: All tests, linting, and formatting must pass before commit
- **ATOMIC DISCIPLINE**: Each commit represents exactly one logical change

<!-- MANDATORY_QUALITY_GATES_END -->

## Strategic Journal Policy

**Query First**: Before starting any complex task, search the journal for relevant domain knowledge, previous approaches, and lessons learned. Use both:
- `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for natural language search across all entries
- `mcp__private-journal__semantic_search_insights` for finding distilled insights (when available)
- `mcp__private-journal__find_related_insights` to discover connections between concepts

Look for:
- Similar problems solved before
- Known pitfalls and gotchas in this domain  
- Successful patterns and approaches
- Failed approaches to avoid

**Record Learning**: The journal captures genuine learning â€” not routine status updates.

Log a journal entry only when:
- You learned something new or surprising
- Your mental model of the system changed
- You took an unusual approach for a clear reason
- You want to warn or inform future agents

ðŸ›‘ Do not log:
- What you did step by step
- Output already saved to a file
- Obvious or expected outcomes

âœ… Do log:
- "Why did this fail in a new way?"
- "This contradicts Phase 2 assumptions."
- "I expected X, but Y happened."
- "Future agents should check Z before assuming."

**One paragraph. Link files. Be concise.**

## Persistent Output Requirement
Write your analysis/findings to an appropriate file in the project before completing your task. This creates detailed documentation beyond the task summary.

## Commit Discipline

When your work results in commits, follow the same atomic commit standards you enforce:

**Atomic Scope Requirements:**
- **Maximum 5 files** per commit
- **Maximum 500 lines** added/changed per commit  
- **Single logical change** per commit
- **No mixed concerns** (avoid "and", "also", "various" in commit messages)

**Attribution Requirements:**
- Add proper self-attribution: `Assisted-By: [agent-name] (claude-sonnet-4 / SHORT_HASH)`
- **Hash Lookup Priority**:
  1. **First choice**: Check `.claude/agent-hashes.json` for your SHORT_HASH (stay in project directory)
  2. **Fallback only**: If mapping file missing, use `git log --oneline -1 .claude/agents/competitive-systems-designer.md | cut -d' ' -f1`
- **Always dual attribution**: Co-Authored-By Claude + Assisted-By agent in every commit you create

**Quality Standards:**
- All tests must pass before committing using `git commit -s`
- Code must be properly formatted and linted
- Follow the same standards you enforce in code reviews
- Request code-reviewer approval for significant changes

**Example commit message:**
```
