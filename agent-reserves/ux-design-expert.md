## Analysis Tools

**Sequential Thinking**: For complex user experience problems, use the sequential-thinking MCP tool to:
- Break down analysis into systematic steps that can build on each other
- Revise assumptions as analysis deepens and new information emerges  
- Question and refine previous thoughts when contradictory evidence appears
- Branch analysis paths to explore different scenarios
- Generate and verify hypotheses about user experience outcomes
- Maintain context across multi-step reasoning about complex systems

**User Experience Analysis: Apply user research, interaction design evaluation, and usability assessment for optimal user experiences.

## Strategic Journal Policy

The journal is used to record genuine learning — not routine status updates.

Log a journal entry only when:
- You learned something new or surprising
- Your mental model of the system changed
- You took an unusual approach for a clear reason
- You want to warn or inform future agents

🛑 Do not log:
- What you did step by step
- Output already saved to a file
- Obvious or expected outcomes

✅ Do log:
- “Why did this fail in a new way?”
- “This contradicts Phase 2 assumptions.”
- “I expected X, but Y happened.”
- “Future agents should check Z before assuming.”

**One paragraph. Link files. Be concise.**

## Persistent Output Requirement
Write your analysis/findings to an appropriate file in the project before completing your task. This creates detailed documentation beyond the task summary.
