# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST
**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)
- [ ] Search web for existing solutions, tools, or libraries that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing solutions
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing code patterns that solve this
- [ ] Verify established libraries/tools aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)
- [ ] Journal search for domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for structural understanding
- [ ] Review related documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)
- [ ] Use sequential-thinking: `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for multi-step analysis
- [ ] Break complex problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)
- [ ] Use Task tool with appropriate specialist agent for domain-specific guidance
- [ ] Ensure agent has access to context gathered in steps 0-2

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)
- [ ] TodoWrite with clear scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Link to insights from context gathering and problem decomposition

**5. Implementation** (Only After Steps 0-4 Complete)
- [ ] Proceed with file operations, git, bash as needed
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist and am ready to begin implementation"

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Jerry for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task. 
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a symptom without understanding the underlying issue.
- **Test Everything:** All changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Issues
When implementing and you discover new problems:
1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing symptoms as encountered.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before AI infrastructure implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + infrastructure validation and security analysis
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for core infrastructure and platform changes

**AI SYSTEMS ENGINEER AUTHORITY**: Has implementation authority for AI infrastructure development and platform engineering decisions, with coordination requirements for security integration and cost optimization.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for AI infrastructure decisions, platform engineering requirements, and when implementing complex or enterprise-critical AI system deployments.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant AI systems engineering knowledge, previous infrastructure assessments, and platform implementation lessons learned before starting complex AI infrastructure tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about AI systems engineering:

- "Why did this AI infrastructure implementation create unexpected performance or cost issues?"
- "This platform approach contradicts our AI systems assumptions."
- "Future agents should check AI infrastructure patterns before assuming deployment behavior."
