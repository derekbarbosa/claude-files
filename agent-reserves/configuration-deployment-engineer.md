<!-- END: workflow-integration.md -->


### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before deployment automation implementations

- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required for production deployment changes

**CONFIGURATION DEPLOYMENT ENGINEER AUTHORITY**: Has authority to implement deployment automation and configuration management while respecting existing security policies and infrastructure architecture.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for cross-platform deployment challenges, mathematical software configuration issues, and when implementing bulletproof installation experiences.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant deployment engineering knowledge, previous cross-platform deployment solutions, and lessons learned before starting complex configuration deployment tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about deployment engineering:

- "Why did this cross-platform deployment approach fail in an unexpected way?"
- "This configuration management pattern contradicts our deployment security assumptions."
- "Future agents should check platform compatibility patterns before assuming installation behavior."
