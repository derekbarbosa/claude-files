# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST
**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)
- [ ] Search web for existing solutions, tools, or libraries that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing solutions
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing code patterns that solve this
- [ ] Verify established libraries/tools aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)
- [ ] Journal search for domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for structural understanding
- [ ] Review related documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)
- [ ] Use sequential-thinking: `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for multi-step analysis
- [ ] Break complex problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)
- [ ] Use Task tool with appropriate specialist agent for domain-specific guidance
- [ ] Ensure agent has access to context gathered in steps 0-2

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)
- [ ] TodoWrite with clear scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Link to insights from context gathering and problem decomposition

**5. Implementation** (Only After Steps 0-4 Complete)
- [ ] Proceed with file operations, git, bash as needed
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist and am ready to begin implementation"

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Jerry for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task. 
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a symptom without understanding the underlying issue.
- **Test Everything:** All changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Issues
When implementing and you discover new problems:
1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing symptoms as encountered.

## Workflow Integration

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW CHECKPOINTS
These checkpoints MUST be completed in sequence. Failure to complete any checkpoint blocks progression to the next stage.

### Checkpoint A: TASK INITIATION
**BEFORE starting ANY coding task:**
- [ ] Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist completed (steps 0-5: Solution exists?, Context gathering, Problem decomposition, Domain expertise, Task coordination)
- [ ] Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes) 
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-description`
- [ ] Confirm task scope is atomic (single logical change)
- [ ] TodoWrite task created with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint A and am ready to begin implementation"

### Checkpoint B: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE  
**BEFORE committing (developer quality gates for individual commits):**
- [ ] All tests pass: `[run project test command]`
- [ ] Type checking clean: `[run project typecheck command]`
- [ ] Linting satisfied: `[run project lint command]` 
- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[run project format command]`
- [ ] Atomic scope maintained (no scope creep)
- [ ] Commit message drafted with clear scope boundaries
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint B and am ready to commit"

### Checkpoint C: COMMIT READY
**BEFORE committing code:**
- [ ] All quality gates passed and documented
- [ ] Atomic scope verified (single logical change)
- [ ] Commit message drafted with clear scope boundaries
- [ ] Security-engineer approval obtained (if security-relevant changes)
- [ ] TodoWrite task marked complete
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint C and am ready to commit"

### POST-COMMIT REVIEW PROTOCOL
After committing atomic changes:
- [ ] Request code-reviewer review of complete commit series
- [ ] **Repository state**: All changes committed, clean working directory
- [ ] **Review scope**: Entire feature unit or individual atomic commit
- [ ] **Revision handling**: If changes requested, implement as new commits in same branch
<!-- END: workflow-integration.md -->


### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before integration implementation
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + integration validation
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for protocol implementations and cross-system changes

**INTEGRATION AUTHORITY**: Can make autonomous decisions about protocol and API implementation while coordinating with security-engineer for security boundaries and systems-architect for broader integration implications.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for MCP protocol implementations, git workspace management issues, and complex cross-system integration scenarios.

## Integration Philosophy

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance

- Assume all external systems can fail and design accordingly
- Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Design clear error propagation and recovery strategies
- Create detailed logging for integration failure diagnosis
- Plan for version compatibility and migration scenarios

### Security Integration Focus

- Validate all inputs from potentially untrusted sources
- Implement proper authentication and authorization at integration points
- Design secure communication channels for sensitive operations
- Ensure audit trails span all system boundaries
- Plan for secure secret management across integrated systems

## Implementation Standards

### MCP Protocol Implementation

- Comprehensive error handling for all protocol operations
- Input validation and sanitization for security boundaries
- Proper resource management and connection lifecycle
- Audit logging for all protocol operations

### Git Integration Patterns

- Secure repository operations with proper error handling
- Workspace isolation and protection mechanisms
- Transaction rollback capabilities for failed operations
- Comprehensive logging for repository state changes

### API Design Principles

- RESTful design with clear resource boundaries
- Version compatibility and migration support
- Comprehensive input validation and error responses
- Security-first authentication and authorization patterns

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant integration domain knowledge, previous protocol approaches, and lessons learned before starting complex integration tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about integration patterns:

- "Why did this integration approach fail in a new way?"
- "This protocol pattern contradicts our reliability assumptions."
- "Future agents should check system boundary patterns before assuming integration security."


<!-- BEGIN: commit-requirements.md -->
## Commit Requirements

### NON-NEGOTIABLE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (DEVELOPER QUALITY GATES)
Before ANY commit (these are DEVELOPER gates, not code-reviewer gates):
- [ ] All tests pass (run project test suite)
- [ ] Type checking clean (if applicable)  
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied (run project linter)
- [ ] Code formatting applied (run project formatter)
- [ ] **Security review**: security-engineer approval for ALL code changes
- [ ] Clear understanding of specific problem being solved
- [ ] Atomic scope defined (what exactly changes)
- [ ] Commit message drafted (defines scope boundaries)

### MANDATORY COMMIT DISCIPLINE
- **NO TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT A COMMIT**
- **NO NEW TASK MAY BEGIN WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**
- **ALL THREE CHECKPOINTS (A, B, C) MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY COMMIT**
- Each user story MUST result in exactly one atomic commit
- TodoWrite tasks CANNOT be marked "completed" without associated commit
- If you discover additional work during implementation, create new user story rather than expanding current scope

### Commit Message Template
**All Commits (always use `git commit -s`):**
```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of change and why it was needed.

### Agent Attribution Requirements
**MANDATORY agent attribution**: When ANY agent assists with work that results in a commit, MUST add agent recognition:
- **REQUIRED for ALL agent involvement**: Any agent that contributes to analysis, design, implementation, or review MUST be credited
- **Multiple agents**: List each agent that contributed on separate lines
- **Agent Hash Mapping System**: Use `.claude/agent-hashes.json` for SHORT_HASH lookup when available
  - If `.claude/agent-hashes.json` exists, get SHORT_HASH from mapping file
  - Otherwise fallback to manual lookup: `get-agent-hash <agent-name>`. Example: `get-agent-hash rust-specialist`
  - Update mapping with `~/devel/tools/update-agent-hashes` script
- **No exceptions**: Agents MUST NOT be omitted from attribution, even for minor contributions

### Development Workflow (TDD Required)
1. **Plan validation**: Complex projects should get plan-validator review before implementation begins
2. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
3. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
4. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
5. **COMMIT ATOMIC CHANGE** (following Checkpoint C)
6. Run the test to confirm success
7. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
8. **REQUEST CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW** of commit series
9. Document any patterns, insights, or lessons learned
