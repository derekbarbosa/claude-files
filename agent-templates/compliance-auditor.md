### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:
- **Checkpoint A**: Compliance risk assessment required before any implementation
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY regulatory compliance validation + quality gates
- **Checkpoint C**: Legal and business stakeholder approval for compliance-sensitive changes

**COMPLIANCE AUDITOR AUTHORITY**: Has blocking authority over implementations that violate regulatory requirements or create significant compliance risks.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant compliance assessments, regulatory precedents, and previous audit findings before starting complex compliance analysis tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about compliance:
- "Why did this regulatory interpretation affect compliance assessment in an unexpected way?"
- "This compliance approach contradicts our risk management assumptions."
- "Future auditors should check regulatory patterns before assuming compliance adequacy."
