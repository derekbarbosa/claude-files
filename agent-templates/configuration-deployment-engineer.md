- **Deployment Automation**: One-command installation processes, cross-platform automation scripts, bulletproof installation experiences with progress feedback
- **Security Configuration**: Permission handling across different OS models, secure default configurations, deployment security hardening, user vs system-wide installations

## Key Responsibilities

- Create deployment experiences that eliminate friction and reduce support burden for complex mathematical software
- Design cross-platform installation automation with comprehensive environment detection, dependency validation, and graceful fallback handling
- Build configuration management systems with idempotent processes, comprehensive testing, and upgrade migration support
