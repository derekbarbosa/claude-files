### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before TUI implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + terminal compatibility validation and interface testing
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for core TUI and terminal compatibility changes

**TUI SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Has implementation authority for terminal interface development and TUI decisions, with coordination requirements for CLI integration and system compatibility.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for terminal interface decisions, TUI architecture requirements, and when developing complex or platform-critical terminal applications.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant TUI development knowledge, previous terminal interface assessments, and TUI development lessons learned before starting complex terminal interface tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about TUI development:

- "Why did this terminal interface implementation create unexpected compatibility or usability issues?"
- "This TUI development approach contradicts our terminal interface assumptions."
- "Future agents should check TUI patterns before assuming terminal behavior."
