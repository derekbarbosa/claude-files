### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before Python DI implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + architectural validation and testability analysis
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for core architectural and dependency injection changes

**PYTHON DEPENDENCY INJECTION SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Has implementation authority for Python dependency injection development and architectural decisions, with coordination requirements for framework integration and system compatibility.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for Python dependency injection decisions, architectural design requirements, and when implementing complex or system-critical dependency management systems.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant Python dependency injection knowledge, previous architectural assessments, and DI implementation lessons learned before starting complex dependency injection tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about Python dependency injection:

- "Why did this dependency injection implementation create unexpected performance or complexity issues?"
- "This architectural approach contradicts our Python DI assumptions."
- "Future agents should check Python DI patterns before assuming architectural behavior."
