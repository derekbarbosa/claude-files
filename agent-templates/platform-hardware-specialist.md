### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:
- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before platform hardware implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + platform validation tests
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for platform-critical changes

**PLATFORM-HARDWARE-SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Must validate all platform-specific implementations and cross-platform abstraction designs.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for platform-specific validation, hardware capability assessment, and cross-platform abstraction scenarios.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant platform knowledge, previous hardware assessments, and cross-platform lessons learned before starting complex platform tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about platform behavior:
- "Why did this platform feature emerge in an unexpected way?"
- "This hardware behavior contradicts our platform assumptions."
- "Future agents should check platform patterns before assuming hardware behavior."
