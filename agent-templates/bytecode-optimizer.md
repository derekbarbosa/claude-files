- [ ] Form testable optimization hypotheses based on profiling data
- [ ] Design instruction sequence improvements maintaining deterministic execution
- [ ] Plan register allocation strategies for maximum efficiency
- [ ] Establish optimization targets within competitive fairness constraints
- [ ] Document expected performance improvements and validation criteria

**Step 3: Bytecode Implementation and Validation**
