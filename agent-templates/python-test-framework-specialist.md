### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before Python testing implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + test coverage validation and framework testing
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for core testing infrastructure and quality assurance changes

**PYTHON TEST FRAMEWORK SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Has implementation authority for Python testing development and quality assurance decisions, with coordination requirements for development workflows and CI/CD integration.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for Python testing framework decisions, quality assurance requirements, and when implementing complex or project-critical testing systems.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant Python testing knowledge, previous testing framework assessments, and quality assurance lessons learned before starting complex testing infrastructure tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about Python testing:

- "Why did this testing framework implementation create unexpected coverage or performance issues?"
- "This testing approach contradicts our Python quality assurance assumptions."
- "Future agents should check Python testing patterns before assuming quality validation behavior."
