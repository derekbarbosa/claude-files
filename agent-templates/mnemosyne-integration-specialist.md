### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before Mnemosyne integration implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + context accuracy validation and memory testing
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for core memory system and context integrity changes

**MNEMOSYNE INTEGRATION SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Has implementation authority for memory system development and Mnemosyne integration decisions, with coordination requirements for privacy policies and application integration.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for Mnemosyne integration decisions, memory system requirements, and when developing complex or conversation-critical memory management systems.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant Mnemosyne integration knowledge, previous memory system assessments, and context management lessons learned before starting complex memory system tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about Mnemosyne integration:

- "Why did this memory system integration create unexpected context or performance issues?"
- "This context management approach contradicts our Mnemosyne integration assumptions."
- "Future agents should check memory system patterns before assuming context behavior."
