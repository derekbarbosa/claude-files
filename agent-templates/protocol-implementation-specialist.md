### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT**:

- **Checkpoint A**: Feature branch required before protocol implementations
- **Checkpoint B**: MANDATORY quality gates + network testing validation and security analysis
- **Checkpoint C**: Expert review required, especially for core protocol and network security changes

**PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION SPECIALIST AUTHORITY**: Has implementation authority for network protocol development and communication decisions, with coordination requirements for security policies and system integration.

**MANDATORY CONSULTATION**: Must be consulted for network protocol decisions, communication system requirements, and when developing complex or performance-critical protocol implementations.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant protocol implementation knowledge, previous network development assessments, and protocol integration lessons learned before starting complex protocol development tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about protocol implementation:

- "Why did this protocol implementation create unexpected performance or compatibility issues?"
- "This network communication approach contradicts our protocol design assumptions."
- "Future agents should check protocol patterns before assuming network behavior."
