Task test-specialist to review the tests in this project, and write out a list of cases where mocks are being used in tests where it is not necessary to make use of mocks, and can be replaced by non-mock tests. You should be specific, and be very good. Do Not Hallucinate. Think quietly to yourself, then act - write the issues. The issues will be given to a developer to executed on. Mocking should be used as a last resort.

Write the issues as new tasks added to specs/$1/tasks.md, and create corresponding prompt files in specs/$1/task-prompts/
