Task clean-code-analyst to review this code, and write out a list of locations where duplicated code exists, and then write issues to de-duplicate the code. You should be specific, and be very good. Do Not Hallucinate. Think quietly to yourself, then act - write the issues. The issues will be given to a developer to executed on, so they should be in a format that is compatible with github issues.

Write the issues out to a file.
