1. Open `TODO.md` and select the first unchecked items to work on.
2. Using ToDoWrite create a list that includes the following steps:
    - A step to task an appropriate agent with completing the item, using the corresponding prompt given in `docs/00-project/plan.md` or `docs/00-project/tdd-prompts.md` if one exists. If not, create an appropriate prompt in the format used by the other prompts with `docs/00-project/plan.md` or `docs/00-project/tdd-prompts.md`
    - A step for committing the change. Use get-agent-hash to get the hash for any agents involved.
    - A step for tasking test-specialist to review any tests created for the item.
    - A step for tasking code-reviewer with doing quality gates for the change.
    - A step for getting approval from Jerry to move forward.
3. Create a new branch.
4. Carry out the steps in the ToDoWrite list.
5. Check off the item in `TODO.md` when it is completed.
