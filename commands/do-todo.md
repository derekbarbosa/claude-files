1. Open `TODO.md` and select the first unchecked items to work on.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Task an appropriate agent to complete the task using the corresponding prompt given in `docs/00-project/plan.md` or `docs/00-project/tdd-prompts.md` if one exists. If not, create an appropriate prompt in the format used by the other prompts with `docs/00-project/plan.md` or `docs/00-project/tdd-prompts.md`
4. Commit your changes, and then task code-reviewer to complete their quality gates. If code-reviewer does not approve, go back to step 4 and address the issues raised.
5. Check off the items on `TODO.md`
